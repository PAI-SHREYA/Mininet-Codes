1. Design and implement a custom network topology in Mininet that includes at least three switches and six hosts. Ensure that the topology allows for redundant paths between switches and demonstrate how to test the connectivity between all hosts.
2.2. Custom Topology Creation in Mininet-WiFi
   - Create a custom wireless network topology in Mininet-WiFi with multiple access points and mobile stations. Ensure the topology reflects a realistic deployment scenario, and validate the connectivity between all nodes.
3. Running a Simple Web Server and Client:
   - Set up a simple network in Mininet with one host acting as a web server and another as a client. Configure the web server to host a basic HTML page and write a script to retrieve this page using the client, demonstrating successful communication.
